# A generator of random quote with the name of the author

## What it looks

## How it works

This is a simple site built with HTML and CSS for a basic visual design (I'm a software developer, not a graphic designer or web developer sorry! ðŸ˜”).

To generate the quote, I used Javascript to fetch random quote from [That's the spirit](https://thatsthespir.it) API.

I also used the [Agify API](https://agify.io) to estimate the potential age associated with the name of the quote's author.

## Where do you can test it ?
