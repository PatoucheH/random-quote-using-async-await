## What it looks

## How it works

This is a site make in HTML / CSS to the really basic visual (I'm software not graphist or web dev sorry !! ðŸ˜”).

To generate the quote, I used Javascript to ask random quote to the API of the site [Visit their site](https://thatsthespir.it).

I also used an [API](https://agify.io) to generate the potential age linked to the name of the authors of the quote.


## Where do you can test it ? 

I'm sure you want to test it or see some quote so just click on this [link](https://patoucheh.github.io/random-quote-using-async-await/) and juge me or suggest me improvements or bugs which need to be fixed.
